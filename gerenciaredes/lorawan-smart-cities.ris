AB  - Urban underground pipelines (UUPs) serve the cardiovascular system of our society and the cornerstone of various smart city and industrial applications. Although the leakage of UUPs can be effectively detected and localized by utilizing the measurements of different types of sensors, the reliable transmission of sensor data remains challenging in large-scale UUPs monitoring due to the harsh underground conditions and the complex urban environments. Motivated by recent successful integration of LoRaWAN and satellites, we investigate in this study the feasibility of the massive machine-type communication (mMTC) based sensing approach, which utilizes the underground-to-satellite (UtS) connectivity for monitoring large-scale UUPs. Specifically, we consider two alternative network architectures, i.e., underground direct-to-satellite (U-DtS) and underground indirect-to-satellite (U-ItS), and discuss their pros, cons, and trade-offs. To assess the feasibility and performance of U-ItS and UtS in large-scale UUPs monitoring, we develop the Monte Carlo UtS simulator, featuring realistic UUPs deployments, regional LoRaWAN configurations, semi-empirical propagation models, two gateway deployment approaches, and data aggregation for U-ItS. Our results reveal that U-DtS fails to counter underground propagation losses and shadowing effects in urban environments. However, U-ItS is demonstrated as a promising solution for the reliable wireless monitoring of UUPs, whose performance can be further improved by utilizing data aggregation. Finally, we verify that the transmission success probability of U-DtS and U-ItS is strongly affected by the underground parameters, i.e., the burial depth of devices and the volumetric water content of soil.

AB  - The deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) with smart sensors has facilitated the emergence of fog computing as an important technology for delivering services to smart environments such as campuses, smart cities, and smart transportation systems. Fog computing tackles a range of challenges, including processing, storage, bandwidth, latency, and reliability, by locally distributing secure information through end nodes. Consisting of endpoints, fog nodes, and back-end cloud infrastructure, it provides advanced capabilities beyond traditional cloud computing. In smart environments, particularly within smart city transportation systems, the abundance of devices and nodes poses significant challenges related to power consumption and system reliability. To address the challenges of latency, energy consumption, and fault tolerance in these environments, this paper proposes a latency-aware, fault-tolerant framework for resource scheduling and data management, referred to as the FORD framework, for smart cities in fog environments. This framework is designed to meet the demands of time-sensitive applications, such as those in smart transportation systems. The FORD framework incorporates latency-aware resource scheduling to optimize task execution in smart city environments, leveraging resources from both fog and cloud environments. Through simulation-based executions, tasks are allocated to the nearest available nodes with minimum latency. In the event of execution failure, a fault-tolerant mechanism is employed to ensure the successful completion of tasks. Upon successful execution, data is efficiently stored in the cloud data center, ensuring data integrity and reliability within the smart city ecosystem.

AB  - Long range wide area network (LoRaWAN) utilize Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) for static Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as smart parking in smart city. Blind ADR (BADR) has been introduced for end devices to manage the resources of mobile applications such as assets tracking. However, the predetermined mechanism of allocating the spreading factors (SFs) to mobile end devices is not adequate in terms of energy depletion. Recently, AI-based solutions to resource allocation have been introduced in the existing literature. However, implementing complex models directly on low-power devices is not ideal in terms of energy and processing power. Therefore, considering these challenges, in this paper, we present a novel Contextual Aware Enhanced LoRaWAN Adaptive Data Rate (CA-ADR) for mobile IoT Applications. The proposed CA-ADR comprises two modes offline and online. In offline mode, we compile a dataset based on successful acknowledgments received by the end devices. Later, dataset is modified by implementing contextual rule-based learning (CRL), following which we train a hybrid CNN-LSTM model. In the online mode, we utilize pre-trained model for efficient resource allocation (e.g., SF) to static and mobile end devices. The proposed CA-ADR has been implemented using TinyML, recommended for low-power and computational devices, which has shown improved results in terms of packet success ratio and energy consumption.

AB  - The drive towards an interconnected world via satellites is reshaping the landscape of communication technologies. This survey comprehensively reviews studies in the Satellite Internet of Things (SIoT) domain, focusing on the role of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Indeed, the global data collection scale in SIoT is ideally suited for data-intensive and sophisticated ML approaches. We highlight the innovative use of ML to address specific SIoT challenges, aiming to identify current trends, methodologies, and outcomes. We considered theoretical, practical, and experimental research, organizing existing publications into a new taxonomy that intersects ML and SIoT categories. Our taxonomy reveals that Deep Learning (DL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Federated Learning (FL) are widely applied to address radio access schemes, resource and network management, and application-specific issues. This survey identifies critical gaps in current research on ML applications in SIoT, such as the lack of differentiation between space-based and ground-based processing, insufficient integration of SIoT-specific metrics, and the oversight of limited computational resources on orbiting satellites. These issues raise concerns about the feasibility and efficiency of proposed solutions. We propose promising research directions based on the derived insights to effectively bridge the gap between ML researchers and industrial SIoT entities.

AB  - Long-Range Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (LR-FHSS) is a recent IoT modulation technique designed for communication between low-power ground end-devices and Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. To successfully decode a frame, an LR-FHSS gateway must receive at least one header replica and a substantial portion of the payload fragments. However, the likelihood of LR-FHSS header loss increases with the number of concurrent transmissions. Moreover, Doppler effects (such as the Doppler shift and the Doppler rate) distort the signals the satellites receive. This paper investigates advanced receiver techniques for recovering LR-FHSS frames with lost headers characterized by significant Doppler effects. This paper‚Äôs main contribution is specifying and validating a novel LR-FHSS receiver model for space‚Äìterrestrial integrated IoT environments. Obtained simulation results prove that our enhanced LR-FHSS receiver can decode a significant portion of the missing frames, improving the overall throughput achievable by using the legacy LR-FHSS receiver.

AB  - Low power wide area networks (LPWAN) have grown significantly in popularity recently, and long-range (LoRa) technologies have drawn notice as a branch of LPWAN. Nevertheless, most current research primarily concentrates on optimizing communication protocols or mechanisms for the LoRa uplink. Considering the demand for large-scale data distribution in the IoT environment, we propose a novel mechanism for LoRa broadcasting with formula derivation and parameter analysis. This scheme adopts the advantages of both LoRa protocols and multi-hop technology that make the data quickly spread to all devices from the center of an area.This scheme optimizes transmission energy consumption by selecting proper relays to alleviate the problem of power shortage in LoRa devices. In this paper, we design an algorithm based on machine learning and reinforcement learning to reduce transmission costs for LoRa devices. The superiority of the proposed scheme in saving communication resources has been demonstrated compared to traditional methods. When broadcasting data downstream, it can save approximately 87.4% of the time. Moreover, through simulation analysis, the proposed algorithm can save at least 12.61% transmitting energy under constraints comparing with the benchmark algorithms.

However, recent advancements in edge computing provided an alternative to cloud servers by deploying the data processing tasks at the edge level, increasing both the efficiency and throughput of the IoT networks. This paper introduces a novel architecture, dubbed ICN-EdgeMesh, that fuses information-centric networking (ICN) with edge mesh computing to provide optimal data access within an IoT network. Furthermore, we employ Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification models to establish the edge-to-things continuum by allocating the optimal node to each IoT device within the network for retrieving the requested data. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of ICN-EdgeMesh against multiple key factors, where it achieved a high data rate (of 9.1 to 10 Mbps) along with ultra-low latency. In addition, the trained SVM model within the proposed scheme achieved 98.1% accuracy, with a true positive rate of 95.3% and a true negative rate of 98.8%, reflecting the optimal network node allocation for efficient data transmission.

However, the relationship between Industry 4.0 technology advances such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and their impact on the earth, environment, people, and biological ecosystems needs further consideration, particularly during pandemics like COVID-19. This paper proposes a cyber-physical Industry 5.0 framework that is compliant with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined by the United Nations (UN) in general and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) in particular. The framework targets three main pillars of SDGs from a technical perspective: global society, economy, and environment. It breaks down the cyber-physical system (CPS) into smaller components, linking them to each of the 17 SDGs and grouping them into broader categories. These components use four leading technologies: blockchain for secure data handling, B5G network function virtualizations, edge-cloud computing for scalable and flexible data processing and AI to deliver insights into the model‚Äôs data. This paper addresses the challenge of monitoring the indicators of 17 SDGs by utilizing Industry 5.0 advancements. It offers practical validation of the framework through use cases in energy and water management. Results demonstrate how the framework can enhance SDG monitoring‚Äôs precision, transparency, and scalability while providing stakeholders with helpful information.

For this purpose, mining specific use cases have been designed such as promoting underground safe areas, performing efficient mining operations or boosting predictive maintenance approaches. Then, specific requirements have been identified and, as a result, the platform has been developed. It consists of four-level layered platform: (1) edge devices layer to manage several sensors deployed in the mines; (2) edge box layer to provide in-mine operations such as filtering, streaming and processing; (3) fog layer which offers an overall perspective of each mine; and (4) cloud layer to centralize the data of all the mines and to provide powerful processing capabilities. In addition, the platform is robustly secured in terms of protecting communications confidentiality and access control and also provides a toolbox aimed at manipulating 3D complex images to obtain operable mine-domain novel user interfaces. Finally, a platform validation is proposed where three different use cases are explained to better show and demonstrate the capabilities of the platform.

Battery-included RESs play an important role in storing surplus energy and injecting it into the grid as needed, enabling better management of electricity consumption. However, as the adoption of RESs in SGs increases, the potential for cyber-attacks, posing significant threats to economic stability, security, and even lives, also grows. Wireless information sharing between agents in SGs increases the risk of these cyber threats, making extensive research necessary to fortify the cybersecurity defenses of RESs within the SG systems. In this paper, the SG‚Äôs concepts, infrastructure, and communication technologies are briefly reviewed, and the related challenges ‚Äî of employing RESs in SGs are thoroughly analyzed. Furthermore, the paper provides a concise analysis of cybersecurity‚Äôs critical role in safeguarding the uninterrupted operation of the RES systems against potential cyber threats. By focusing on the integration of RESs into SGs, this study aims to equip emerging researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the realm of RESs. Additionally, it offers recommendations for future research directions, enabling the development of innovative solutions that can enhance the security and reliability of RESs within SG infrastructures.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has a large and rapidly expanding number of deployed devices, which leads to a significant global energy consumption footprint. Diverse IoT use cases, including smart cities, smart grids, Industry 5.0, eHealth, and autonomous vehicles, are contributing to this increase in energy consumption. Optimising energy utilisation is crucial to sustaining the exponential growth of IoT applications, which demand stringent delays and latencies measured in milliseconds and microseconds. There are additional complexities with the emergence of edge, fog, and cloud computing and the need to manage the energy consumption at all the layers. In this paper, mechanisms that can be used to minimise energy consumption within an edge‚Äìfog‚Äìcloud IoT architecture for real-time IoT applications are being proposed. We investigate mechanisms for optimal node selection, primarily focusing on minimising energy usage while adhering to the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of various IoT requests. The mechanisms include genetic, modified genetic, and delay-aware algorithms tailored explicitly for real-time IoT applications. We evaluated the proposed mechanisms using a simulation of diverse network scenarios. The results presented in the paper provide insight into balancing processing time and energy efficiency, which are critical considerations in sustainably developing IoT applications in an edge‚Äìfog‚Äìcloud IoT architecture.

Despite the widespread integration of smart devices across various sectors like smart homes, wearable‚Äôs, smart cities, and workplaces, the mining industry has been comparatively slow in adopting innovative technologies. However, it is essential to recognize the vital role played by the mining sector in powering energy systems, manufacturing components for smart devices, and employing over 4.5 million individuals globally, often in demanding and harsh conditions. This paper presents a prototype Industrial IoT and Digital Twin platform to optimize industrial automation in traditional mining operations. Moreover, it proposes a digital twin reference architecture employing Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) and simulation techniques to validate the reference architecture within a mining context. The results indicate an impressive 98% accuracy achieved within a time frame of 10.25 s.

To maximize battery life and ensure secure communications, lightweight key exchange protocols like Ephemeral Diffie‚ÄìHellman Over COSE (EDHOC) are essential. To further optimize energy efficiency, EDHOC can be combined with the Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) protocol, which is designed to compress and fragment data packets. This work demonstrates that EDHOC and SCHC can be successfully integrated to establish secure session keys in Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. The attained results showcase that security mechanisms can be implemented in resource-limited devices with minimal energy impact, extending battery life. The experiments showed it is possible to compress the EDHOC exchange messages up to a ‚àº54% and to reduce the energy consumption by a ‚àº20%, while maintaining the CPU time levels in a cost-effective way. By designing IoT devices with these directives, it is possible to reduce the overall environmental footprint and increase the devices‚Äô operational lifespan.

AB  - Smart City Applications encompass many characteristics that increase the risk of failures, such as context-awareness, adaptiveness, distribution and heterogeneity. Therefore, it is important to implement fault-tolerant mechanisms to produce more reliable applications. This study presents a systematic literature review of fault tolerance techniques that have been proposed for, or applied to Smart City Applications. It also characterizes faults, errors and failures that may occur in these systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that provides a broad picture of the research area and points out research limitations and directions. We selected 43 primary studies and performed initial classifications (e.g., based on type of research, type of contribution, application domains and subdomains, and type of system architecture). We further classified and discussed the selected studies based on types of fault tolerance techniques and types of faults and failures. System Reconfiguration, Diversity, and Retry are classical techniques that have been investigated in this domain. Many fault and failure types have also been addressed. While those well-known techniques have been explored for introducing fault tolerance capabilities into Smart City Applications, others have been overlooked. Moreover, evidence on the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed fault tolerance solutions is still very limited. Editor‚Äôs note: Open Science material was validated by the Journal of Systems and Software Open Science Board.

AB  - The emergence of new technologies such as Machine Learning (ML) and the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized several applications and industries. Smart agriculture and irrigation are among these industries that witnessed tremendous advancement in how environmental and agricultural-related data are remotely sensed, collected, presented, and analyzed. This paper presents a smart irrigation system based on the IoT and ML to provide farmers with an efficient way to remotely sensing the environmental and agricultural-related parameters such as air temperature, pressure, humidity, and soil moisture. These data are sent wirelessly using long range wireless area networks (LoRaWAN) and stored in the cloud to be used to predict the future parameters‚Äô values utilizing a novel enhanced wind-driven optimization-least square support vector machine (EWDO-LSSVM) algorithm. The proposed algorithm significantly improves the accuracy of predicting irrigation-related data, thus assisting farmers in making smart decisions about when and how to irrigate their farms. The presented results demonstrate that the EWDO-LSSVM outperforms both the adaptive wind-driven optimization (AWDO-LSSVM) and the original wind-driven optimization (WDO-LSSVM) algorithms, particularly in terms of the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) metrics. The findings of this paper reveal that EWDO-LSSVM outperformed other models with a prediction accuracy up to 87.50% for all the parameters and forecasting periods, hence making the proposed model more accurate for smart irrigation systems.

AB  - The urgent need to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from the transportation sector, a major contributor to environmental degradation, underscores the necessity for transitioning to sustainable, resource-efficient systems. Circular economy (CE) principles provide a promising framework by emphasizing resource optimization, waste reduction, and the extension of asset life cycles while emerging digital technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and 3D printing are instrumental in driving this transition by enhancing resource flow optimization, predictive maintenance, and real-time decision-making. This study uses the PRISMA methodology to critically analyze the existing literature and propose a theory-supported framework through a systematic literature review. The conceptual framework and theoretical propositions present the triad interaction between circular economy (CE) practices and digital technologies within the context of transportation infrastructure. This integration of relevant theories is key to enhancing practical applications for improved efficiency, while also promoting circular economy practices in transportation using these technologies. This study provides a foundation for future research and practical applications, contributing to a more sustainable and resource-efficient transportation sector. Furthermore, it expands the understanding of how digital technologies can support the circular economy in transportation infrastructure‚Äîan area that has so far received limited academic attention.
