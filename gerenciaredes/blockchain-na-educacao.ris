AB  - In the manufacturing sector, vast volumes of data are generated at the field layer, offering valuable insights into the quality of produced parts, process efficiency, and various other applications. Traditionally, these data have been managed and analyzed through centralized infrastructures either in a cloud or on-premise. However, to tackle trust-related concerns from data providers and enable value creation through services by external companies, the concept of data spaces and ecosystems has emerged. Multiple drafts for standards for ecosystems exist; all offering different approaches for trustful cross-company collaboration. Notably, the Gaia-X initiative aims to establish a federated and sovereign data infrastructure. This paper introduces a novel approach for automatically publishing production data and associated services to multiple instances of such ecosystems directly from the shopfloor by deploying microservices on edge devices close to the machine. The developed architecture combines data acquisition of machine data through standards like OPC UA, creation of verifiable metadata description for the collected data sets, and publishing the metadata to different data and service ecosystems adhering to the Gaia-X standard, enabling trustful machine-to-machine connections. It is shown how services like data storage, ERP/MES, and asset management systems can be seamlessly deployed along the cloud edge continuum into this process. This approach fosters data integrity, sovereignty and enables coherent integration within the evolving cooperative manufacturing landscape.

AB  - The growing necessity for robust security and trust in systems has prompted the widespread adoption of blockchain technology in student information management systems (SIMS). While existing literature has concentrated on the development of blockchain-based student information management systems (BC-SIMS), a notable gap remains in the evaluation of these systems. This study addresses this gap by employing a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach. Recognizing the inherent uncertainties in BC-SIMS evaluation due to inadequate information, the study introduces the Probabilistic Reliable Linguistic Term Sets (PRLTSs) theory to address these problems. As a result, the Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to the Compromise Solution (MARCOS) method is extended into the Probabilistic Reliable Linguistic environment, resulting in the Probabilistic Reliable Linguistic-Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to the Compromise Solution (PRL-MARCOS) method. This method supports the evaluation and selection decisions on BC-SIMS in higher education institutions. The study further designs the Probabilistic Reliable Linguistic-Coefficient of Variation (PRL-CV) method to determine the relative importance of selection criteria. Twenty selection criteria for BC-SIMS are identified through a literature review, and an illustrative case study is employed to assess the practicality and validity of the proposed PRL-CV-MARCOS approach in a higher educational institution. Experimental results highlight cost reduction (0.0778), interoperability (0.0717), security (0.0628), service improvement (0.0557) and responsiveness (0.0538) as the top five criteria for BC-SIMS selection, with BC-SIMS P5 identified as the optimal solution for managing student information. Finally, a comprehensive comparative and sensitivity analysis verifies the stability and effectiveness of the proposed decision support model.

AB  - Today, scientific research is increasingly data-centric and compute-intensive, relying on data and models across distributed sources. However, it still faces challenges in the traditional cooperation mode, due to the high storage and computing cost, geo-location barriers, and local confidentiality regulations. The Jupyter environment has recently emerged and evolved as a vital virtual research environment for scientific computing, which researchers can use to scale computational analyses up to larger datasets and high-performance computing resources. Nevertheless, existing approaches lack robust support of a decentralized cooperation mode to unlock the full potential of decentralized collaborative scientific research, e.g., seamlessly secure data sharing. In this work, we change the basic structure and legacy norms of current research environments via the seamless integration of Jupyter with Ethereum blockchain capabilities. As such, it creates a Decentralized Virtual Research Environment (D-VRE) from private computational notebooks to decentralized collaborative research ecosystem. We propose a novel architecture for the D-VRE and prototype some essential D-VRE elements for enabling secure data sharing with decentralized identity, user-centric agreement-making, membership, and research asset management. To validate our method, we conducted an experimental study to test all functionalities of D-VRE smart contracts and their gas consumption. In addition, we deployed the D-VRE prototype on a test net of the Ethereum blockchain for demonstration. The feedback from the studies showcases the current prototype's usability, ease of use, and potential and suggests further improvements.

AB  - The industrial sector is undergoing a pervasive digital transformation in the current landscape, particularly in steel, cement, chemicals, and refineries. These are collectively termed "complex decarbonization industries (CDI)," where reducing emissions poses a significant challenge. Green hydrogen (GH) production, conducted sustainability, represents an innovative solution that facilitates energy storage and reduces reliance on fossil fuels. However, producing green hydrogen requires effective management and flexible strategic decisions to ensure transparency and environmental friendliness. This paper utilizes blockchain technology enablers (BCTE) to track carbon emissions and ensure the origin of green gas in these sectors while independently exploring its relationship to a sustainable supply chain (SSC). GH is presented as a mediating variable in this relationship. Utilizing a cross-sectional methodology, the research gathered data via interviews and an online survey from 462 employees in companies participating in the 2022 Shams Dubai program under the aegis of the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority in the UAE. The Structural Equation Modeling - Analysis of Moment Structures (SEM-AMOS) technique was used to perform the statistical analyses. Based on interviews and survey results in the UAE's CDI, the findings show that BCTE directly impacts SSC's social and environmental dimensions, while its effect on the economic dimension is negative. However, when GH mediated this relationship, the results were indirectly positive in enhancing the SSC in complex decarbonization industries without any negative environmental effects. Adopting GH is a way to reward sustainable behavior. The findings of this study could inform the UAE's policymaking, particularly in designing incentives for GH adoption in industrial sectors and creating regulatory frameworks that encourage BCTE integration for energy tracking and emissions reduction. This approach could serve as a model for similar economies striving for sustainable industrial practices.

AB  - As blockchain technology continues to evolve, it has fostered an extensive ecosystem of applications and platforms. This dynamic landscape is characterized by a myriad of innovative solutions, ranging from decentralized finance and supply chain management to digital identity and voting systems, each contributing to the ongoing advancement and adoption of blockchain technology across various sectors. Achieving interoperability among these applications and platforms poses a significant challenge due to their use of distinct protocols, and remains a bottleneck hindering the widespread adoption of blockchain technologies. Addressing this challenge requires designing a universal interoperability protocol while ensuring compliance with the security and privacy constraints specific to each blockchain, thus adding complexity. We propose an agnostic interoperability protocol designed for seamless asset movement across independent private blockchain networks, regardless of their individual protocols. This protocol leverages incentive-driven smart contract and Zero-Knowledge Proofs to establish a decentralized, secure, and privacy-focused framework for interoperability. We conduct a security analysis using game theory and provide both theoretical and empirical evaluations of the protocol end-to-end delay. Through a comprehensive use case, we demonstrate the secure deployment of the proposed protocol for asset movement between two private blockchains. We also discuss the trade-offs between cost and delay in cross-blockchain transactions. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with existing interoperability schemes showcases the proposed interoperability scheme superiority in terms of robustness, privacy preservation, and verifiability.

AB  - In the education sector, blockchain is currently at the end of the peak of inflated expectations in Gartner‚Äôs Hype Cycle. Thus, it is crucial to understand whether this technology meets the expectations of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). We go on an expedition to identify blockchain application scenarios and its potential for HEI administration‚Äîthe universities are digitalized to just 23.3%. Current information systems research addresses classifications of blockchain-based projects (application level) rather than their technical realization (protocol level). Thus, when evaluating blockchain application scenarios in HEI administration, we intensively consider the technical side of blockchain-based projects. We perform a three-step approach: (1) systematic literature review, (2) qualitative exploratory semi-structured interviews to supplement information on market-ready solutions, and (3) an evaluation of the potential of the blockchain-based projects identified, based on HEI administration requirements. We find that the leading blockchain application scenarios are credential verification and record-sharing. At the protocol level, we obtain equivocal results regarding the technical realization of projects, e.g., their underlying blockchain types and storage models. At the application level, when discussing the potential of different projects, we find that most of them address adaptability, complexity decomposition, and cost reduction requirements between HEIs; interest diversity and stakeholder collaboration between HEIs and business actors; privacy and trust between HEIs and students.

Objective: In this paper, we'd like to propose an architecture and the technical aspects concerning creating a BBIE, underlining the supplied advantages and the logic decomposition among the business and storage components. Method: The requirements are derived from the current needs of the collaborative business and the data collected by surveying practitioners. To meet these needs, we followed the Grounded Theory research approach. We validate our architectural schema against a case study on managing a wine supply chain involving different companies and supervision authorities. Results: The proposed solution integrates blockchain-based applications with the existing information system as a module of the ecosystem, leveraging on the low costs, scalability, and high-level security because of the restricted access to the network. Conclusion: We must go a long way in deepening and refining the possibilities offered by technology in supporting innovative multi-organizational business models. BBIEs can contribute substantially to paving the way in such a direction.

AB  - The metaverse is a nascent concept that envisions a virtual universe, a collaborative space where individuals can interact, create, and participate in a wide range of activities. Privacy in the metaverse is a critical concern as the concept evolves and immersive virtual experiences become more prevalent. The metaverse privacy problem refers to the challenges and concerns surrounding the privacy of personal information and data within Virtual Reality (VR) environments as the concept of a shared VR space becomes more accessible. Metaverse will harness advancements from various technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Extended Reality (XR) and Mixed Reality (MR) to provide personalized and immersive services to its users. Moreover, to enable more personalized experiences, the metaverse relies on the collection of fine-grained user data that leads to various privacy issues. Therefore, before the potential of the metaverse can be fully realized, privacy concerns related to personal information and data within VR environments must be addressed. This includes safeguarding users‚Äô control over their data, ensuring the security of their personal information, and protecting in-world actions and interactions from unauthorized sharing. In this paper, we explore various privacy challenges that future metaverses are expected to face, given their reliance on AI for tracking users, creating XR and MR experiences, and facilitating interactions. Moreover, we thoroughly analyze technical solutions such as differential privacy, Homomorphic Encryption, and Federated Learning and discuss related sociotechnical issues regarding privacy.

AB  - With the evolution of next-generation communication networks, ensuring robust Core Network (CN) architecture and data security has become paramount. This paper addresses critical vulnerabilities in the architecture of CN and data security by proposing a novel framework based on blockchain technology that is specifically designed for communication networks. Traditional centralized network architectures are vulnerable to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, particularly in roaming scenarios where there is also a risk of private data leakage, which imposes significant operational demands. To address these issues, we introduce the Blockchain-Enhanced Core Network Architecture (BECNA) and the Secure Decentralized Identity Authentication Scheme (SDIDAS). The BECNA utilizes blockchain technology to decentralize data storage, enhancing network security, stability, and reliability by mitigating Single Points of Failure (SPoF). The SDIDAS utilizes Decentralized Identity (DID) technology to secure user identity data and streamline authentication in roaming scenarios, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches during cross-network transmissions. Our framework employs Ethereum, free5GC, Wireshark, and UERANSIM tools to create a robust, tamper-evident system model. A comprehensive security analysis confirms substantial improvements in user privacy and network security. Simulation results indicate that our approach enhances communication CNs security and reliability, while also ensuring data security.

AB  - As the global population continues to grow, the enormous stress on our environment and resources is becoming impossible to ignore. A focus on producing and consuming as cheaply as possible has created an economy in which objects are briefly used and then discarded as waste, featuring a linear lifecycle that creates an enormous amount of waste. The alternative to the linear economy ‚Äútake-make-waste‚Äù is called the ‚Äúcircular economy‚Äù. Under this paradigm, materials are recycled to build new products or components that are designed and built to promote their reuse and refurbishment. This assures the continuous (re-)exploitation of existing resources, reducing the extraction of new raw materials. However, customers often reject these reused or refurbished products under the suspicion that they do not meet the same usability, safety, or performance levels of new products. In this sense, trustworthy records of historical details of refurbished products could increase consumers‚Äô confidence in products and components of the ‚Äúcircular economy‚Äù, prioritizing trustworthiness, reliability, and transparency. This work presents a new certification tool based on blockchain technology to guarantee trusted, accurate, transparent, and traceable lifecycle information of products and their components and to generate trustworthy certificates to probe refurbished product historical details. This tool aims to enhance refurbished product visibility by creating the basis for making the circular economy a reality in any domain.

AB  - During the digital age of healthcare, it is crucial to utilize medical data scattered across different healthcare institutions to improve diagnostic precision and customize treatment strategies. A common solution to achieve this is establishing an authorization service that facilitates secure sharing of medical data and promotes interoperability among various healthcare institutions. However, there is a risk of a single point of failure because the majority of authorization systems in use rely on a central trusted service. This paper proposes DAMFSD, a decentralized authorization model with flexible and secure permissions delegation for medical data sharing. Specifically, patients can transfer their permissions to reliable institutions or individuals for flexible management and delegation while they retain control and monitor their permissions. We use cryptographic techniques for secure and fine-grained delegation and smart contracts to enable decentralized and flexible delegation. Finally, we performed a security analysis to demonstrate DAMFSD‚Äôs feasibility and conducted a performance evaluation on the permissioned blockchain to show its applicability.
